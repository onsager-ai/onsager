description: Manage an Onsager PR after it's been pushed — spec-issue linking, CI triage, review-comment discipline, webhook subscription, and label alignment. Triggers include "CI is failing", "check is red", "link this issue", "Closes vs Part of", "respond to review", "subscribe to PR", "triage PR", "the PR is ready" or when a github-webhook-activity event arrives. Paired with `onsager-dev-process` (overall loop), `issue-spec` (spec creation), and the GitHub-triggered Claude Routines under `.claude/routines/`.

# onsager-pr-lifecycle

Everything that happens after `git push` on an Onsager PR. Covers spec-issue
linking (and its enforcement), CI triage, review-comment response discipline,
webhook subscriptions, and the manual fallback for label alignment when
routines aren't configured.

## Tool discipline

- **No `gh` CLI, no `hub`, no direct GitHub API.** Always use `mcp__github__*`.
- Scope is restricted to `onsager-ai/onsager`. Don't query other repos.
- Don't open PRs unless the user explicitly asks. Creating one is a
  one-way door in this project's workflow.

## Spec-issue linking (mandatory)

Every PR must either:

1. Link to a spec issue in its body via `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` /
   `Resolves #N` (slice complete) or `Part of #N` / `Refs #N` (scaffolding),
   **OR**
2. Carry the `trivial` label (typo, doc-only, one-line obvious fix).

If neither, the PR is out of process. Ask the author (via PR comment) to
either add a spec link — creating one via `issue-spec` if none exists — or
apply the `trivial` label.

### Which keyword to use

GitHub closes issues on merge when PR body contains one of:
`close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolves`,
`resolved` — followed by `#N`.

Pick the keyword based on **what this PR actually delivers**:

| PR delivers                                                  | Use         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| The acceptance test / vertical slice the spec asks for       | `Closes #N` |
| A bug fix for a specific defect                              | `Fixes #N`  |
| Scaffolding / one phase of a multi-phase spec                | `Part of #N` |
| Related work that shouldn't close the spec                   | `Refs #N`   |

`Part of` / `Refs` are **not** auto-close keywords — they just cross-link in
the UI. Use them for scaffolding so the spec stays open for the real slice.

Edit the PR body via `mcp__github__update_pull_request` (don't open a new PR
just to fix the link). Put the linking line at the top of the body.

### The `## Delivers` subsection

For `Part of #N` PRs (and ideally all PRs), include a `## Delivers`
subsection in the body listing the exact Plan items this PR ticks, copied
verbatim from the spec's `## Plan`. The `pr-merged-progress` routine uses
this on merge to tick the parent spec's checkboxes. Without it, a human
has to tick them manually.

Example PR body:

```markdown
Part of #42

## Delivers
- [x] Add `STIGLAB_SESSION_TIMEOUT` env var to server config (default: 30m)
- [x] Implement per-session inactivity timer in `SessionManager`

## Summary
First slice of the session-timeout work. Timer plumbing only; event
emission lands in the next PR.
```

## Issue progress labels

The linked spec issue's status label should always reflect reality:

| Spec label | What it means | Who flips it |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| `draft` | AI/human-drafted, not yet reviewed | Human (via `planned` move) |
| `planned` | Ready for implementation | Human (alignment gate) |
| `in-progress` | At least one open PR | `pr-opened-progress` routine |
| closed | Delivered, tests passing | GitHub (via `Closes` keyword on merge) |

**If Claude Routines are configured** (see `.claude/routines/`), these
transitions happen automatically on PR events:

- PR open → `planned` becomes `in-progress`.
- PR closed unmerged with no other open PR → reverts to `planned`.
- PR merged with `Closes #N` → issue auto-closes (GitHub).
- PR merged with `Part of #N` → Plan checkboxes tick on the parent spec.

**If routines are NOT configured**, you are responsible for the manual
transitions. On PR open, flip the linked spec's label via
`mcp__github__issue_write`. On merge, either GitHub auto-closes (for
`Closes`) or tick checkboxes on the parent spec manually.

Never bypass the `draft → planned` gate from within this skill — that's a
human decision. If the linked spec is still `draft`, comment on the PR
asking the author to drive the spec through review first.

## CI triage

### Accessing logs

`WebFetch` **cannot read authenticated GitHub Actions logs** — both
`https://github.com/.../actions/runs/X/job/Y` and
`https://api.github.com/repos/.../actions/jobs/Y/logs` return 403 or an
error page. Don't waste time on them. Work instead from:

1. `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: get_check_runs` — gives
   step name, status, timings.
2. **Local reproduction** after syncing main. Re-run the failing step with
   the exact flags from `.github/workflows/rust.yml`.

### Common failure patterns in this repo

| Symptom                                                       | Usual cause |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `cargo build --workspace` fails, passes locally               | CI built the merge preview; main has drifted. `git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main` on the branch. |
| `error: no variant ... found for enum`                        | Same: main removed an enum variant. Grep match arms. |
| `cargo test -p onsager-spine` fails at runtime                | New migration not listed in `.github/workflows/rust.yml`'s migration step. |
| `assert!(events.0 >= N)` in DB tests returns 0                | SQL filter on `data->>'type'` — the tag is under `data->'event'->>'type'`, or use `event_type` column. |
| Flaky parallel test runs                                      | Global `DELETE FROM events WHERE stream_type = 'registry'` — scope by `data->'event'->>'workspace_id' = $1`. |

### Migration numbering collision (frequent!)

Main and PR both add `NNN_foo.sql` → rename yours to the next unused `NNN`.
Update **all three**: `justfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/rust.yml`.

## Review comments

**Fix the code. Don't reply per comment.** Multiple reviewers (Copilot + human)
often flag the same defect; a single commit that fixes it resolves all of them
at once.

Reply *only* when:
- Declining a suggestion (explain why, briefly).
- The comment is a question, not a bug report.
- Asking for clarification before acting.

Use `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment` for threaded replies,
never top-level comments unless summarizing multiple responses at once.

**Copilot vs real defect**: Copilot sometimes flags idiomatic Rust as broken
(e.g. `&foo.to_string()` temporaries that actually live long enough). Verify
locally before "fixing" a non-bug — but prefer the clearer form (let binding)
even when the lint was wrong.

If a review comment raises a design concern that the spec didn't address,
pause and update the linked spec issue (add an open question under
`## Alignment`, comment on the spec, let a human decide). Don't silently
expand scope in the PR.

## Webhook subscription

Events from CI and reviewers arrive wrapped in `<github-webhook-activity>`
tags. The harness forwards them as user messages.

- Subscribe once per PR with `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity` after the
  PR is created (or the user asks you to watch it).
- Unsubscribe with `mcp__github__unsubscribe_pr_activity` when done — not
  strictly necessary but cleaner.
- Events are already filtered to CI failures + reviews. Treat each as
  actionable; skip only if it's a duplicate of one you just addressed.

Routine-triggered events (label flips, Plan checkbox ticks) do not flow
through webhook subscription — they're handled in the routine's own
session, visible at claude.ai/code under the routine's run list.

## Reporting back to the user

After handling a webhook event, end with one or two sentences: what the
failure was, what you changed, whether CI is re-running. Don't dump the full
commit message in chat — the user can see it on the PR.
