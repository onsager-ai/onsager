# Advanced Coordination Patterns — ClawDen Implementation of Organizational Patterns

## Overview

Spec 017 defines six organizational coordination patterns (hierarchical, pipeline, committee, departmental, marketplace, matrix) as implementation-agnostic algorithms. This spec is **ClawDen's implementation** of those patterns — the Rust trait bindings, `AgentEnvelope` protocol integration, `clawden.yaml` config schema, and CLI commands.

Spec 005 establishes master-worker as the foundational coordination pattern. This spec extends it with the full organizational pattern taxonomy from spec 017, implemented as pluggable `CoordinationPattern` trait objects on top of the same `AgentEnvelope` protocol and `MessageBus`.

Child spec `013-ai-native-coordination-primitives` extends these with ClawDen implementations of AI-native primitives (also defined abstractly in spec 017).

For the abstract pattern definitions, rationale, and invariants, see **spec 017**. This spec focuses on concrete implementation.

## Design

### Coordination Pattern Trait

Abstract the coordination logic into a pluggable trait so the task engine is generic over patterns:

```rust
trait CoordinationPattern {
    /// Decompose a task into work units for the available agents
    fn decompose(&self, task: &Task, agents: &[AgentInfo]) -> Vec<WorkUnit>;
    /// Route a work unit to the appropriate agent(s)
    fn route(&self, unit: &WorkUnit, agents: &[AgentInfo]) -> Vec<AgentId>;
    /// Process a completed work unit result and decide next steps
    fn on_result(&mut self, result: &TaskResult) -> CoordinationAction;
    /// Check if the overall task is complete
    fn is_complete(&self) -> bool;
}

enum CoordinationAction {
    /// Forward result to next stage/agent
    Forward { to: AgentId, payload: TaskAssignment },
    /// Broadcast result to a set of agents for review/voting
    Broadcast { to: Vec<AgentId>, payload: AgentEnvelope },
    /// Aggregate into final result
    Aggregate,
    /// Wait for more results before deciding
    Wait,
    /// Escalate to a higher-level coordinator
    Escalate { to: AgentId },
}
```

### Pattern 1: Hierarchical Delegation

Recursive master-worker. A leader delegates to sub-leaders who further delegate to their workers, forming a tree.

- `TaskAssignment` gains a `parent_task_id` field to form task trees.
- Sub-leaders are agents that have both a leader role (can decompose/delegate) and a worker role (receive tasks from above).
- Result aggregation bubbles up: leaf workers → sub-leaders → top leader.
- Depth limit in config to prevent unbounded recursion.

```yaml
fleet:
  teams:
    engineering:
      leader: architect
      sub_teams:
        frontend:
          leader: frontend-lead
          workers: [ui-agent, css-agent]
        backend:
          leader: backend-lead
          workers: [api-agent, db-agent]
      coordination: hierarchical
      max_depth: 3
```

### Pattern 2: Pipeline (Assembly Line)

Sequential stages where output of one agent/team feeds into the next. Each stage can internally use master-worker parallelism.

- Task engine maintains a `stages: Vec<PipelineStage>` with ordered execution.
- Each stage defines input/output schema for type-safe handoff.
- Stage failure halts the pipeline (with configurable retry or skip).
- Supports conditional branching: stage output can route to different next stages.

```yaml
fleet:
  pipelines:
    code-review:
      stages:
        - name: plan
          agent: planner
        - name: implement
          team: coding-team
          coordination: master-worker
        - name: review
          agent: reviewer
        - name: merge
          agent: merger
          condition: "review.approved == true"
```

### Pattern 3: Committee (Peer Consensus)

Equal-rank agents deliberate collectively. Unlike blind majority-vote (spec 005), agents see each other's responses and can iterate.

- Rounds-based: each round, all committee members submit a response.
- After each round, all responses are broadcast to all members.
- Members can revise their position in the next round.
- Termination: unanimous agreement, quorum threshold, or max rounds reached.
- Useful for code review panels, architectural decisions, quality assessment.

```yaml
fleet:
  teams:
    review-board:
      members: [reviewer-1, reviewer-2, reviewer-3]
      coordination: committee
      consensus:
        strategy: quorum
        quorum_threshold: 0.66
        max_rounds: 3
```

### Pattern 4: Departmental (Cross-Team Routing)

Multiple specialist teams with a top-level router that directs entire task categories to the right department. Departments have independent internal coordination.

- A router agent (or rule-based classifier) assigns tasks to departments.
- Each department is a self-contained team with its own coordination pattern.
- Inter-department communication goes through department gateway agents.
- Supports escalation paths when a department can't handle a task.

```yaml
fleet:
  departments:
    research:
      team: research-team
      capabilities: [web-search, analysis, summarization]
    engineering:
      team: coding-team
      capabilities: [code, test, deploy]
    qa:
      team: qa-team
      capabilities: [review, test, security-audit]
  router:
    agent: dispatcher
    strategy: capability-match
```

### Pattern 5: Marketplace (Task Bidding)

Inverts control flow — instead of top-down assignment, tasks are posted and agents bid.

- Task posted to a job board with requirements (capabilities, deadline, priority).
- Qualified agents submit bids (estimated time, confidence, cost).
- Allocation strategy selects the winner: lowest-cost, highest-confidence, fastest.
- Agents can decline or timeout, triggering re-auction.
- Self-organizing: no explicit leader needed.

```yaml
fleet:
  marketplace:
    agents: [agent-1, agent-2, agent-3, agent-4]
    coordination: marketplace
    allocation: lowest-cost
    bid_timeout_seconds: 10
```

### Pattern 6: Matrix (Multi-Team Membership)

Agents belong to multiple teams simultaneously with dynamic role switching.

- Agent declares available capacity across teams (e.g., 60% frontend, 40% review).
- Scheduling layer resolves conflicts when multiple teams claim the same agent.
- Priority-based preemption: higher-priority team can claim agent from lower-priority work.
- Avoids deadlocks via capacity reservation and timeout-based release.

## Plan

- [ ] Define `CoordinationPattern` trait and `CoordinationAction` enum.
- [ ] Refactor spec 005's master-worker logic to implement `CoordinationPattern`.
- [ ] Implement hierarchical delegation with `parent_task_id` and depth limiting.
- [ ] Implement pipeline coordination with stage sequencing and conditional branching.
- [ ] Implement committee consensus with round-based deliberation.
- [ ] Implement departmental routing with capability-based team dispatch.
- [ ] Implement marketplace bidding with configurable allocation strategies.
- [ ] Implement matrix multi-team membership with capacity scheduling.
- [ ] Extend `clawden.yaml` fleet config to support all organizational pattern types.
- [ ] Implement pattern composability — sub-patterns within pipeline stages and nested coordination.
- [ ] Add `clawden fleet patterns` command to list and describe available patterns.
- [ ] Design trait extension points for AI-native patterns (spec 013) from day one.

## Test

- [ ] Master-worker from spec 005 works identically when expressed as a `CoordinationPattern`.
- [ ] Hierarchical: 3-level tree delegates and aggregates correctly; depth limit enforced.
- [ ] Pipeline: 4-stage pipeline passes results sequentially; conditional branch skips a stage.
- [ ] Committee: 3 agents reach quorum after 2 rounds of deliberation.
- [ ] Departmental: router sends coding task to engineering, research task to research team.
- [ ] Marketplace: 3 agents bid on a task; lowest-cost wins; declined bid triggers re-auction.
- [ ] Matrix: agent serving two teams respects capacity split; preemption works on priority.
- [ ] Invalid config (cycle in hierarchy, pipeline with no stages) rejected at parse time.
- [ ] `CoordinationPattern` trait is extensible: adding a new pattern requires only a new impl, no changes to the engine.
